This is my repo for the Year 4 Medical imaging processing Module
This code was used to create models to identify brain tumours based on the BRATS dataset with a focus on reducing the number of imaging modalities requried for the segemntation of the tumour.
it intentiaaly uses all permutations of the imaging modalities to see which is best and necessary for future use.
